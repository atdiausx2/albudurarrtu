\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

In the world of education, the path to success is often visualized as a
linear progression, where students follow a predefined journey from
kindergarten to graduation. However, the reality is far more complex.
Various reasons lead students to choose to deviate from this path. These
students have encountered different challenges, circumstances, or a lack
of proper resources that have led them to drop out of university.

In this dataset provided to us, we will delve deeper into understanding
the reasons why students have dropped out of the university, based on
the data at our disposal. We will leverage our social knowledge to
comprehend the factors that influenced their decision to drop out and
work to prevent such occurrences if the issues are within the
university's purview. Our goal is to offer solutions, support, and the
necessary resources to facilitate students' educational journeys. We
will also use the analysis we've conducted on the dropout students to
learn from their experiences and chart a unique educational pathway with
fewer dropouts.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Starting from preliminary school we are told that having an education is
very important for your future or that without higher education your job
possibilities are going to be very limited. While primary education is
mandatory, having higher education is not. But why do people actually
take their time and resources to pursue it? Well, according to studies
the most important factor for pursuing higher education is job
acquisition. Some other factors may include increased income in the
existing job, improved work conditions or increased ability for
retirement. All in all they do all tie up to materialistic benefits in
the end. Of course, other, more intrisic factors include seeking for
additional knowledge or self-fulfillment. There are also factors like
meeting new friends, improving social interaction skills or just wanting
to make a difference in the world. Of course factors that cannot be
ignored are social pressure, meaning that having friends that want to
pursue higher education can influence ones own decision or influence of
family members. Pursuing higher edication is good, but what about people
who prematurely end their studies and drop out? What could be the
factors that lead to such a decision? Based on the study and datasets
that we used for our research there are multiple factors that influence
dropping out.

Nevertheless, pursuing higher education and actually getting the degree
has some tangible benefits. According to an OECD -- Education at a
Glance 2019 research paper, \enquote{On average across OECD countries,
adults with a short-cycle tertiary degree earn 20\% more than adults
with upper secondary education. The earnings advantage increases to 44\%
for those with a bachelor's degree and to 91\% for those with a master's
or doctoral degree.} With this in mind, it is important for government
and educational institutions to ensure high level of graduates in
society to ensure economic growth and overall increase in well-being. To
measure the success of this goal, it is important to set KPI's, track
them and make educated conclusions on what needs to be done or is being
done right to reach the goal of higher educated society.

\hypertarget{target-metrics-and-kpi}{%
\subsection{Target Metrics and KPI}\label{target-metrics-and-kpi}}

In this particular case, KPI's will be chosen based on datasets of
Portugese Schools but most likely data can be generalised, atleast for
Europe, as the region and sociodemographics are not so different. Even
though there are many factors that influence the success of graduation,
only factors that can be proven upon by government and educational
institutions will be chosen. 1st KPI chosen is Academic support. Based
on the dataset students who had support had 3x lower dropout rates than
students that didn't have. This means that governments should be
incentivised to allocate a higher amount of budget towards education to
give financial aid and motivate students to complete their studies.

2nd KPI chosen is Institutional improvements. Again, based on datasets,
schools with improvements have 40\% less dropout rate than schools
without. This is something that can be improved by incentivizing
teachers with higher salaries or giving schools more budget to improve
their workstations.

3rd KPI chosen is grades. Datasets tell us that the higher the average
grade, the lower the dropout rate. Usually students that have low grades
are uninterested in the subjects which could be due to having chosen not
the right program for them or that the way lectures and information is
presented is uninteresting or outdated. Either way this can be improved.
Increasing the possibility that the student has chosen the right program
for him can be done by introducing more \enquote{open days} in higher
education institutions and having more upfront information about what
can be expected from programs. The overall lecture performance can be
improved by taking more time to have up-to-date information presented
and teachers having decent motivation of teaching students. This can be
achieved by increasing teacher salaries and institutions having more
control over teachers and information they present to students.

The students are from multiple countries, but the overwhelming majority
of the students are from Portugal. It would be interesting to see how
the students' admission grade depends on their previous qualification,
particularily because of that many students from abroad are from the
Ultramarine Territories where it's more challenging to get comparable
education.

\includegraphics{report_AzadhdhinNedalYunisAlFraijat_files/figure-pdf/cell-7-output-1.png}

Also, there is a drastic imbalance over yet another crucial factor: age.
As it was mentioned previously, students of age are far less ubiquitous,
can have far more incentives to abandon studies and with smaller
potential to apprehension of material. Indeed, this is eloquently
manifested on the next graph.

\includegraphics{report_AzadhdhinNedalYunisAlFraijat_files/figure-pdf/cell-8-output-1.png}

Q. v. the sizes of the bins for dropout students differ far less than
the total size for the name of the student.

If the hypothesis about some external factors, The target variable
should be much dependent on previous grades,\\
The datapoint cloud, however, shows that this rule has a lot of
exceptions.

\includegraphics{report_AzadhdhinNedalYunisAlFraijat_files/figure-pdf/cell-10-output-1.png}

We can draw the following observations:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{distribution of admission grades} is roughly normal with
  most students scoring between \textbf{\emph{60 to 80 marks}}.
\item
  The \textbf{distribution of previous qualifications} (grades) is also
  the same with most of them having grades in between \textbf{\emph{12
  and 16}}.
\item
  There is seen a \textbf{positive correlation} between admission grade
  and previous qualification grade indicating students with higher
  previous qualifications tend to have higher admission grades.
\end{itemize}

In the previous graphs, we considered qualitative columns that are more
or less exogenous to the dataset.

However, the majority of columns of this dataset are qualitative and
they do not much fit, so we would opt for analysis of discriminate
groups. This was the visualization for the few quantitative columns,
which shows the natural interconnection between the curricularly accrued
units in the 1st and the 2nd year, which are in turn mostly unrelated to
the admission grade. This is understandable since the grades are
commonly based on the successfulness of the local program and student's
toil, while the students backgrounds are commonly different and this
puts them into inequitable positions when passing the admission exams.

We also consider the impact of scholarships and other compensations in
academic support, which should quench the complications associated with
adaptations in new environment.

\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{report_AzadhdhinNedalYunisAlFraijat_files/figure-pdf/cell-11-output-2.png}

\textbf{Observations :}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Students coming from \emph{low - income families have a higher dropout
  rate} than compared from middle - income and high - income families.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, not only the pecuniary, but also institutional aspects can
be improved -- and so influence the academic success. Below we
demonstrate how the institutional improvements can influence the
dropout.

\begin{verbatim}
Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Effect of Institutional Improvements on Student Retention')
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{report_AzadhdhinNedalYunisAlFraijat_files/figure-pdf/cell-12-output-2.png}

\textbf{Observations :}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Schools having \emph{implemented institutional improvements yeilds a
  significant lowering of the dropout rate} when compared to those
  without.
\end{itemize}

In different studies, it is quite common to compare the academic success
of a student with the academic successes of ttheir parents as this has
both direct and indirect effects , s. a. i. e. both are connected to
welfare, but also it can be that there is another channel of knowledge
transmission to the younger generation.

\begin{verbatim}
Text(0.5, 1.0, "Influence of Mother's Occupation on Dropout Rates")
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{report_AzadhdhinNedalYunisAlFraijat_files/figure-pdf/cell-13-output-2.png}

\textbf{Observations :}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The bar chart shows that \emph{Students with mothers in lower-level
  occupations} tend to have higher dropout rates than compared to those
  with mothers in high paying jobs.
\item
  This also may suggest the mother's occupation can influence student
  retention, emphasizing the need for financial support and family
  engagement.
\end{itemize}
