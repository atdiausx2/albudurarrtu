0.1 make OHE categorials for qualitative -- 
0. normalize quantitative , do need to normalize qualitative? 
0.2 train with all data an AE -> get latent space 
0.3 remove with HDBSCAN 
1. apply extended isolation forest 
2. bootstrap the weaker class 
3. learn the most meaningful with baruta  permutation & random forest 
4. on reduced features, build gradient boosting
